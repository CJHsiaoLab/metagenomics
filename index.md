description: Application of admixture mixed model approach to metagenomic counts data
---

We apply the topic model/ admixture approach to the metagenomic data on HMP V3-5 region data provided by Joe Paulson.

### Exploration of HMP V3-5 data

* [Admixture plot crease/fossa + whole data](project/hands_HMP/hands_data.html)
* [Exploring only fossa/crease, PCA, q-value, individual Structure](project/hands_HMP/explore_fossa_crease.html)
* [gene expression patterns fossa/crease](project/hands_HMP/fossa_crease_qtlcharts.html)

### Analysis of the Cell Paper Data
* [Structure analysis for age, gender, Case/Control status](project/cell_paper/cell_paper_analysis.html)
* [post Structure, Age constraining, Imp feature extraction analysis](project/cell_paper/post_structure_analysis.html)
